# Hi Keys Project (Work in Progress)

Welcome to Hi Keys! This is my personal project in constant evolution, where I explored exciting and challenging technologies like WebGL and ThreeJs to create a visually stunning experience. Hi Keys is a fictional product that combines the power of WebGL with the versatility of NextJS, using GSAP for smooth animations and CSS Modules for efficient style management. It's developed in TypeScript, adding an extra layer of type safety to the project.

With Hi Keys, I've taken my development skills to the next level, delving into the world of 3D graphics and advanced web programming using React and react-three-fiber.

You can check out the current state of Hi Keys on [Vercel](https://hi-keys-landing.vercel.app/), but keep in mind that it's a work in progress, and I'm excited about the future improvements and features I have planned.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for web applications.
- **GSAP**: Animation library for creating smooth transitions and visual effects.
- **react-three-fiber**: Library for working with WebGL and Three.js in React applications.
- **WebGL**: Technology for 3D graphics in the browser.
- **CSS Modules**: Modular CSS styling methodology for efficient management.
- **TypeScript**: Typed programming language for safer development.

Feel free to explore Hi Keys and discover how technology can transform ideas into visually captivating experiences.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
